                    <p>I am a third year student studying mathematics and computer
                    science at the <a class="styled" href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">
                    University of Toronto</a>. I'm most interested in areas of
                    computer science that are closely involved with maths; namely
                    logic, complexity and algorithms. As a developer I like being
                    part of projects that innovate in these areas and allow me to
                    continue learning as I work.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not absorbed in my school work you can probably find me

                    something that I've listed below. </p>

                    <h3>Evolution of Light</h3>

                    <p> A Roguelike video-game written in Python using the <a
                    class="styled"
                    href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/curses.html">curses</a>
                    library. Players will need to navigate a dungeon, fending off
                    monsters as they delve deeper and deeper. The focus of the game
                    is to progress through a timeline of lighting technology which
                    will allow players to take manipluate the light that
                    illuminates the dungeon levels. How to player chooses to light
                    up the environment will determine if they live or die.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-1-2"> 
                    <p> The game is still under development. Most basic features of
                    a roguelike game are implemented, with a special focus on field
                    of vision which will be used extensively as a game mechanic
                    along with the lighting technologies. Next steps are to smooth
                    out NPC combat, as well as some basic light mechanics.</p>
