                    <h2>evolution_of_light</h2>
                    <p>A roguelike dungeon crawler written in python. The
                    objective of the game is to progress your character through
                    the "evolution of light", from lightning to LEDs. A demo of
                    the game, along with the source and other technical 
                    information can be found at
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kmanbrusse/evolution_of_light/">

                    <p>This is something I put together over a weekend
                    so that I could share my work and interests. Making the 
                    website was easy, but making the content is still a work in 
                    progress. The source for this website is available at 
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kmanbrusse/personal_website/">
                    bitbucket.org/kmanbrusse/personal_website/</a> <br>
                    and the finished product is right in front of you. </p>
