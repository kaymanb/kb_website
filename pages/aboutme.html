                    <p>My full name is Kayman Johannes Brusse.<br>
                    <br>
                    I very much enjoy school, especially courses in maths, 
                    logic and theoretical computer science. I am
                    focused on learning everything I can and want to make the
                    most of the time I have there.<br>
                    <br>
                    My other hobbies are athletics, reading and the wild outdoors.
                    I am big fan of hiking and canoeing, and while I am in the city
                    I do my best to bike everywhere I go. I read mostly
                    fiction, and if you're looking for a recomendation <a
                    href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995336-the-tsar-of-love-and-techno">
                    this is the best book</a> I have read in a long time.
